# Story 2.4: Session Management API

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Frontend Developer,
**I want** secure API endpoints to manage a session,
**so that** the UI can display and update the game state.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. API provides secure endpoints to retrieve session details including P/L calculations and strategy recommendations
2. API provides endpoint to add new spins to an active session with proper validation
3. API provides endpoint to end/close an active session
4. API returns comprehensive session data including running totals, statistics, and next betting recommendations
5. All endpoints use proper authentication and authorization (auth:sanctum middleware)
6. API responses follow consistent JSON format with proper error handling
7. API includes proper validation for all input data and meaningful error messages

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3 completion:
- PLCalculationService and MartingaleStrategyService are fully implemented and tested
- Session model has convenient accessor methods for P/L calculations and strategy recommendations
- Services follow Laravel dependency injection patterns and are stateless
- Comprehensive test coverage established with 35 service tests
- Financial precision constants implemented for consistent decimal handling

### Data Models
**Session Model** [Source: app/Models/Session.php]:
- Located in app/Models/Session.php with game_sessions table
- Key fields: id, user_id, start_time, end_time, created_at, updated_at
- Relationships: belongsTo User, hasMany Spins
- Accessor methods: getTotalPL(), getRunningPLTotals(), getSessionStatistics(), getNextBettingAction()
- Mass assignable: user_id, start_time, end_time

**Spin Model** [Source: app/Models/Spin.php]:
- Located in app/Models/Spin.php with spins table
- Key fields: id, session_id, result, bet_amount, pl, created_at, updated_at
- Relationship: belongsTo Session
- Decimal casting: bet_amount, pl (2 decimal places)
- Mass assignable: session_id, result, bet_amount, pl

### API Specifications
**Authentication Pattern** [Source: routes/api.php]:
- All protected routes use auth:sanctum middleware
- Current pattern: Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->group()
- User access via $request->user() in controllers

**Response Format Pattern** [Source: app/Services/SessionService.php]:
- Consistent JSON structure with success/message/data fields
- ISO 8601 datetime formatting using toISOString()
- HTTP status codes: 201 for creation, 200 for success, 500 for errors
- Error responses include success: false, message, and error fields

### Component Specifications
**Controller Pattern** [Source: app/Http/Controllers/SessionController.php]:
- Lean controllers that delegate to services
- Constructor dependency injection for services
- Try-catch blocks for error handling
- Consistent response format with JsonResponse return types

**Service Layer Pattern** [Source: app/Services/SessionService.php]:
- Services handle business logic and database transactions
- Format methods for consistent API response data
- Database transactions using DB::transaction() for data integrity
- Load relationships using Eloquent load() method

**Request Validation Pattern** [Source: app/Http/Requests/SessionCreateRequest.php]:
- Located in app/Http/Requests/ directory
- authorize() method for user-based authorization
- rules() method for validation rules
- messages() method for custom error messages

### File Locations
Based on established project structure:
- Controllers: app/Http/Controllers/
- Services: app/Services/
- Request classes: app/Http/Requests/
- Feature tests: tests/Feature/
- API routes: routes/api.php

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Pattern** [Source: existing tests]:
- Feature tests for API endpoints in tests/Feature/
- Test authentication, authorization, validation, and business logic
- Use Laravel's testing helpers for API testing
- Follow established naming: {Feature}Test.php
- Test both success and error scenarios

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Backend: Laravel (latest)
- API: REST API
- Authentication: Laravel Sanctum
- Database: MySQL 8.0+
- Testing: PHPUnit

**Performance Considerations** [Source: Story 2.3 insights]:
- Services are stateless and optimized for scalability
- Use single-pass calculations where possible
- Proper use of Eloquent relationships to prevent N+1 queries
- Database transactions for data integrity

### Security Requirements
- All endpoints require authentication via auth:sanctum
- Users can only access their own sessions and spins
- Proper validation on all input data
- No exposure of sensitive data in error responses

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- Feature tests: tests/Feature/SessionManagementApiTest.php, tests/Feature/SpinManagementApiTest.php
- Follow existing pattern of comprehensive test coverage

### Testing Standards
- Use PHPUnit as established testing framework
- Test all endpoints with authenticated and unauthenticated requests
- Test authorization (users accessing only their own data)
- Test validation rules and error messages
- Test business logic integration with existing services
- Ensure 100% coverage of new controller and service methods

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- Laravel's built-in testing features for API testing
- Database transactions for test isolation
- Factory classes for test data generation
- Follow existing test patterns from SessionCreationTest.php

## QA Results

### Review Date: Today
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
**Excellent implementation quality!** The developer has successfully implemented a comprehensive Session Management API that follows Laravel best practices and established project patterns. The code demonstrates professional-level architecture with proper separation of concerns, robust error handling, and extensive test coverage.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `app/Services/SpinService.php`
  - **Change**: Replaced service locator anti-pattern `app(SessionService::class)` with proper constructor dependency injection
  - **Why**: Service locator pattern violates dependency inversion principle and makes testing/mocking difficult
  - **How**: Added constructor injection of SessionService, improving testability and following SOLID principles

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ **Excellent** - Follows Laravel coding standards with proper type hints, docblocks, and PSR-12 compliance
- Project Structure: ✓ **Perfect** - All files placed in correct locations following established project patterns
- Testing Strategy: ✓ **Outstanding** - 22 comprehensive tests with 118 assertions covering all scenarios and edge cases
- All ACs Met: ✓ **Complete** - All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and thoroughly tested

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Refactored SpinService for proper dependency injection (app/Services/SpinService.php)
- [x] Verified all tests pass after refactoring (22 tests, 118 assertions)
- [ ] Consider extracting authorization logic to a trait if pattern expands across more services (future enhancement)
- [ ] Consider adding response caching for frequently accessed session details (performance optimization)

### Security Review
**No security concerns found.** Implementation demonstrates excellent security practices:
- Proper authentication via auth:sanctum middleware on all endpoints
- Authorization checks prevent users from accessing other users' sessions/spins
- Input validation with meaningful error messages
- No exposure of sensitive data in error responses
- Database transactions ensure data integrity and prevent race conditions

### Performance Considerations
**Performance optimized and scalable:**
- Services use stateless design for horizontal scalability
- Efficient database queries with proper eager loading (`with(['user', 'spins'])`)
- Database transactions prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity
- Response formatting optimized with single-pass data transformation
- Minimal API response payload with only necessary data

### Architecture Excellence
**Outstanding architecture implementation:**
- Perfect adherence to Laravel service layer patterns
- Clean separation of concerns (Controllers → Services → Models)
- Consistent error handling across all endpoints
- RESTful API design following conventional patterns
- Proper use of dependency injection and SOLID principles

### Final Status
✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

**Outstanding work!** This implementation represents professional-grade code quality with comprehensive testing, excellent architecture, and robust error handling. The developer successfully created a complete Session Management API that integrates seamlessly with existing P/L calculation and strategy services. The single refactoring improvement enhances the already excellent foundation. Ready for production deployment!
