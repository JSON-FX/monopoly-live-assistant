### Data Models
TypeScript interfaces available for frontend integration:
- User: { id: number, name: string, email: string } [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]
- Session: { id: number, userId: number, startTime: string, endTime: string | null } [Source: architecture/data-models.md#session]
- Spin: { id: number, sessionId: number, result: string, betAmount: number, pl: number } [Source: architecture/data-models.md#spin]

### Component Specifications
Card component structure to use for dashboard cards:
- Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent, CardFooter components available [Source: project-structure/resources/js/components/ui/card.tsx]
- Card styling: "bg-card text-card-foreground flex flex-col gap-6 rounded-xl border py-6 shadow-sm" [Source: project-structure/resources/js/components/ui/card.tsx]
- Header spacing: "flex flex-col gap-1.5 px-6" [Source: project-structure/resources/js/components/ui/card.tsx]
- Content padding: "px-6" [Source: project-structure/resources/js/components/ui/card.tsx]

### File Locations
Following established project structure:
- Page location: resources/js/pages/live-session.tsx [Source: project-structure/resources/js/pages/]
- Route definition: routes/web.php with auth middleware [Source: project-structure/routes/web.php]
- Layout pattern: AppLayout with breadcrumbs [Source: project-structure/resources/js/layouts/app-layout.tsx]

### Technical Constraints
Technology stack requirements:
- React with TypeScript for component development [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Shadcn UI components for consistent styling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Laravel Sanctum authentication patterns [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Project Structure Notes
Current frontend follows pattern established in dashboard.tsx:
- AppLayout wrapper with breadcrumbs [Source: project-structure/resources/js/pages/dashboard.tsx]
- Grid-based responsive layout with gap-4 spacing [Source: project-structure/resources/js/pages/dashboard.tsx]
- PlaceholderPattern component for development placeholders [Source: project-structure/resources/js/pages/dashboard.tsx]
- Border styling: "border-sidebar-border/70 dark:border-sidebar-border" [Source: project-structure/resources/js/pages/dashboard.tsx]

### Testing
No specific guidance found in architecture docs - will follow established patterns from existing page components.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-27
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
**Excellent implementation** with strong adherence to established patterns. The developer successfully created a Live Session page that follows all architectural guidelines and maintains consistency with the existing codebase. The implementation demonstrates good understanding of React/TypeScript patterns, proper component composition, and responsive design principles.

### Refactoring Performed
During review, I identified and fixed an inconsistency issue where placeholder cards were using raw div elements instead of the established Card component pattern.

- **File**: resources/js/pages/live-session.tsx
  - **Change**: Replaced raw div placeholder cards with proper Card components and added descriptive labels
  - **Why**: Ensures consistent styling, maintains design system integrity, and improves future maintainability
  - **How**: All placeholder areas now use the same Card component with proper semantic structure and helpful labels for future developers

- **File**: resources/js/test/pages/live-session.test.tsx  
  - **Change**: Updated tests to account for multiple Card components and added assertions for new descriptive labels
  - **Why**: Tests needed to reflect the improved component structure and validate the new user-friendly placeholder labels
  - **How**: Enhanced test coverage to verify consistent Card usage and presence of descriptive placeholder text

### Compliance Check
- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Follows React/TypeScript patterns, proper component structure, consistent naming
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files correctly placed, follows established directory conventions  
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive test suite (10 tests), covers all functionality, no regressions
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented with quality execution

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Fixed Card component consistency across all layout areas (live-session.tsx)
- [x] Added descriptive labels to placeholder areas for better developer experience
- [x] Enhanced test coverage to validate improved component structure
- [x] Verified responsive design works correctly across breakpoints
- [x] Confirmed proper authentication middleware protection
- [x] Validated navigation integration with appropriate icon choice

### Security Review
**No security concerns.** Implementation properly uses authentication middleware, follows established security patterns, and contains no hardcoded sensitive data. Route protection is correctly implemented.

### Performance Considerations  
**Performance optimized.** Uses efficient React patterns, minimal re-renders, proper component composition, and follows responsive design best practices. No performance anti-patterns detected.

### Architecture Excellence
**Outstanding architecture implementation.** Perfect adherence to established patterns from dashboard.tsx, proper use of AppLayout system, consistent Card component usage, and maintainable code structure. The refactoring performed enhances long-term maintainability.

### Final Status
**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

**Exceptional work!** This implementation represents professional-grade frontend development with excellent attention to detail, consistent design system usage, and comprehensive testing. The minor refactoring performed during review has elevated the code quality even further. The Live Session page provides a solid foundation for future Epic 3 stories and maintains perfect consistency with the established application architecture.
