# Story 2.1: Session Data Models and Relationships

## Status

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5 completion: User model already includes a sessions() relationship method prepared for this implementation. The codebase follows standard Laravel patterns with lean controllers and direct model usage (no service layer implemented yet).

### Data Models
**Session Model Requirements** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
```typescript
export interface Session {
  id: number;
  userId: number;
  startTime: string;
  endTime: string | null;
  // ... and other fields
}
```

**Spin Model Requirements** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
```typescript
export interface Spin {
  id: number;
  sessionId: number;
  result: string;
  betAmount: number;
  pl: number; // Profit or Loss
}
```

### API Specifications
No specific API guidance found in architecture docs for this data layer story.

### Component Specifications
No frontend components required for this backend data layer story.

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure patterns:
- Models: `app/Models/Session.php`, `app/Models/Spin.php`
- Migrations: `database/migrations/YYYY_MM_DD_HHMMSS_create_sessions_table.php`, `database/migrations/YYYY_MM_DD_HHMMSS_create_spins_table.php`
- Factories: `database/factories/SessionFactory.php`, `database/factories/SpinFactory.php`
- Tests: `tests/Unit/SessionTest.php`, `tests/Unit/SpinTest.php`, `tests/Feature/SessionRelationshipsTest.php`

### Testing Requirements
Based on existing testing patterns and test files:
- Use PHPUnit for backend testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Follow multi-layered testing approach [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Create both unit tests (model validation, relationships) and integration tests (database operations)
- Test files should be organized in `tests/Unit/` and `tests/Feature/` directories
- Use model factories for consistent test data generation

### Technical Constraints
- Laravel Latest version [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- MySQL 8.0+ database [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use Laravel Eloquent ORM patterns
- Follow existing migration patterns from users table migration
- Maintain data integrity with proper foreign key constraints
- Use Laravel's built-in validation features

### Database Schema Patterns
Based on existing users migration:
- Use `$table->id()` for primary keys
- Use `$table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()` for foreign keys
- Use `$table->timestamps()` for created_at/updated_at
- Use appropriate data types: `string()`, `decimal()`, `timestamp()`, etc.
- Add indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test File Location**: `tests/Unit/` for model tests, `tests/Feature/` for integration tests
- **Test Standards**: Follow PHPUnit conventions and Laravel testing best practices
- **Testing Frameworks**: PHPUnit for backend testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Specific Requirements**: Test model relationships, validation rules, database constraints, and factory generation

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 3.5 (Development Agent)

### Debug Log References
- Resolved table naming conflict: Laravel's default `sessions` table conflicted with our game sessions. Renamed to `game_sessions` table.
- Fixed migration order: Ensured `game_sessions` migration runs before `spins` migration for proper foreign key constraints.
- Resolved test failures: Updated decimal casting expectations (Laravel returns strings, not floats) and factory logic for losing state.

### Completion Notes List
- **Session Model**: Created with proper relationships, validation rules, and table name specification (`game_sessions`)
- **Spin Model**: Created with relationships to Session, decimal casting for monetary fields, and validation rules
- **Database Migrations**: Created `game_sessions` and `spins` tables with proper foreign keys, indexes, and cascade behavior
- **Model Factories**: Implemented with realistic Monopoly Live game data, including win/lose states and proper relationship handling
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 28 tests created covering unit tests (model validation, relationships) and integration tests (database constraints, cascade behavior)
- **All Acceptance Criteria Met**: All 7 ACs verified through passing tests
