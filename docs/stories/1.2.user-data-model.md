## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- Laravel Sanctum (v4.2.0) successfully installed and configured
- MySQL 8.0+ database container operational in Docker environment
- Laravel 12.21.0 confirmed working with proper database connectivity
- Authentication scaffolding and migrations published
- Testing framework (PHPUnit) verified functional

### Data Models
**User Model Specification** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#User]:
```typescript
export interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

### Current Implementation Status
**Existing Files Identified:**
- User model exists: `app/Models/User.php` (Laravel standard implementation)
- Users migration exists: `database/migrations/0001_01_01_000000_create_users_table.php`
- User factory exists: `database/factories/UserFactory.php`

**Current User Model Attributes:**
- `fillable`: ['name', 'email', 'password']
- `hidden`: ['password', 'remember_token']
- `casts`: ['email_verified_at' => 'datetime', 'password' => 'hashed']

**Current Database Schema:**
- Primary key: `id` (auto-increment)
- Required fields: `name`, `email` (unique), `password`
- Optional fields: `email_verified_at`, `remember_token`
- Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`

### Technical Framework Context
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Backend Framework: Laravel (Latest)
- Database: MySQL 8.0+
- Authentication: Laravel Sanctum (Latest)
- Testing: PHPUnit (Latest)

### File Locations
Based on Laravel conventions and current project structure:
- User Model: `app/Models/User.php` (exists)
- Database Migration: `database/migrations/0001_01_01_000000_create_users_table.php` (exists)
- User Factory: `database/factories/UserFactory.php` (exists)
- Unit Tests: `tests/Unit/UserTest.php` (to be created)

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Testing Framework: PHPUnit for backend unit and integration tests
- Test Organization: Follow testing pyramid with focus on unit tests
- Test File Location: `tests/Unit/` for model unit tests
- Test File Naming: `{ModelName}Test.php` convention

**Specific Testing Requirements for User Model:**
- Test model instantiation and attribute assignment
- Test fillable and hidden attributes functionality
- Test password hashing and casting
- Test User factory for test data generation
- Test database constraints and validation
- Integration test with Laravel Sanctum authentication

### Project Structure Notes
No structural conflicts identified. Current Laravel structure aligns with project architecture specifications.

  - **Why**: Improves type safety and IDE support, following modern PHP best practices
  - **How**: Provides explicit `HasMany` return type and notes about future Session model dependency

- **File**: tests/Unit/UserTest.php  
  - **Change**: Converted from deprecated `/** @test */` annotations to modern PHPUnit `#[Test]` attributes
  - **Why**: Eliminates PHPUnit deprecation warnings and ensures future compatibility with PHPUnit 12+
  - **How**: Updated all test methods with PHP 8 attributes and added return type hints

- [x] Added documentation comment about Session model dependency
- [x] Verified all tests pass after refactoring (40/40 tests passing)

### Security Review
✓ **Excellent Security Implementation**
- Password hashing properly configured via Laravel casting
- Sensitive attributes (password, remember_token) properly hidden from serialization
- Sanctum integration correctly implemented for API authentication
- Mass assignment protection properly configured with fillable attributes

### Performance Considerations
✓ **Well Optimized**
- Database schema includes proper indexing (unique email constraint)
- Efficient model relationships prepared for future Session integration
- Factory patterns optimized for testing performance
- No N+1 query concerns in current implementation

### Final Status
✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

### Additional Notes
This implementation demonstrates excellent Laravel practices and provides a solid foundation for the User management system. The comprehensive test suite (14 test cases, 28 assertions) ensures reliability, and the Sanctum integration properly supports the planned API authentication requirements. The refactoring improvements enhance code quality without affecting functionality.
