## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 completion:
- User model fully implemented with Laravel Sanctum HasApiTokens trait
- Database schema includes all required fields (id, name, email, password, timestamps)
- User factory available for testing data generation
- Comprehensive unit tests established for User model (14 test cases)
- Authentication scaffolding properly configured

### Current Implementation Status
**Existing Files Analysis:**
- Registration route exists: `POST /register` in `routes/auth.php`
- Registration controller exists: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisteredUserController.php`
- Registration UI exists: `resources/js/pages/auth/register.tsx`
- Registration tests exist: `tests/Feature/Auth/RegistrationTest.php`

**Current Registration Controller Analysis:**
- Validation rules: name (required|string|max:255), email (required|unique), password (required|confirmed)
- User creation with proper password hashing via Hash::make()
- Automatic login after registration via Auth::login()
- Redirect to dashboard after successful registration
- Registered event fired for email verification workflow

**Current Registration UI Analysis:**
- Uses Inertia.js useForm hook for form handling
- Implements proper TypeScript interfaces for form data
- Uses Shadcn UI components (Input, Label, Button)
- Includes InputError component for validation display
- Proper loading states and form submission handling
- Accessible form structure with proper labels and tabindex

### Data Models
**User Model Specification** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#User]:
```typescript
export interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

**Current User Model Implementation:**
- Fillable fields: ['name', 'email', 'password']
- Hidden fields: ['password', 'remember_token'] 
- Password casting: 'hashed' for automatic bcrypt hashing
- Sanctum integration: HasApiTokens trait included

### Technical Framework Context
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: React (Latest) with TypeScript
- UI Components: Shadcn UI (Latest)
- Backend: Laravel (Latest)
- Authentication: Laravel Sanctum (Latest)
- Database: MySQL 8.0+
- Frontend Testing: Vitest (Latest)
- Backend Testing: PHPUnit (Latest)

### File Locations
**Backend Files:**
- Controller: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisteredUserController.php` (exists)
- Routes: `routes/auth.php` (exists)
- User Model: `app/Models/User.php` (exists)
- Migration: `database/migrations/0001_01_01_000000_create_users_table.php` (exists)

**Frontend Files:**

- Auth Layout: `resources/js/layouts/auth-layout.tsx` (exists)
- Input Components: `resources/js/components/ui/input.tsx`, etc. (exist)

**Test Files:**
- Feature Tests: `tests/Feature/Auth/RegistrationTest.php` (exists)
- Frontend Tests: To be created in appropriate test directory structure

### API Specifications
**Registration Endpoint** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Method: POST
- Route: `/register`
- Middleware: guest (prevents already authenticated users)
- Request Body: {name: string, email: string, password: string, password_confirmation: string}
- Success Response: Redirect to dashboard
- Error Response: Validation errors with 422 status

### Security Considerations
**Password Security** [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]:
- Laravel's default password rules enforced via Rules\Password::defaults()
- Automatic password hashing via User model casting
- Password confirmation required to prevent typos
- Secure password storage with bcrypt hashing

**Authentication Security:**
- Laravel Sanctum integration for API authentication
- CSRF protection enabled by default
- Email uniqueness constraint prevents duplicate accounts
- Guest middleware prevents registration bypass

### Testing Requirements
**Backend Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Framework: PHPUnit for feature and unit tests
- Test Organization: Follow testing pyramid with comprehensive feature tests
- Test File Location: `tests/Feature/Auth/` for authentication tests
- Coverage: Registration success, validation failures, security constraints

**Frontend Testing Standards:**
- Framework: Vitest for component and integration tests
- Test Organization: Component-focused testing with user interaction simulation
- Test Coverage: Form interactions, validation display, submission handling
- Accessibility: Test WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation

**Specific Test Scenarios:**
- Valid registration with all required fields
- Invalid email format validation
- Duplicate email registration prevention
- Password confirmation mismatch handling
- Required field validation for name, email, password
- Successful automatic login after registration
- Dashboard redirect after successful registration
- Form loading states during submission
- Error message display and clearing

### Project Structure Notes
No structural conflicts identified. Current Laravel and React structure aligns perfectly with project architecture specifications. All existing authentication scaffolding follows Laravel conventions and integrates properly with Inertia.js and Sanctum.

### Performance Considerations
- Registration form uses client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Server-side validation prevents invalid data submission
- Database constraints ensure data integrity
- Optimized form submission with proper loading states
