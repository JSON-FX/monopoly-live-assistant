## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1 completion: Session model exists with `game_sessions` table to avoid Laravel's built-in sessions conflict. Session model has proper relationships to User and validation rules. Session factory is available with realistic test data. The data foundation is solid and ready for API integration.

### Data Models
**Session Model Available** [Source: Story 2.1 completion]:
- Uses `game_sessions` table with proper foreign keys
- Has belongsTo User and hasMany Spins relationships
- Includes validation rules for user_id, start_time, end_time
- Supports factory creation for testing

**User Model Integration** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:
```typescript
export interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

### API Specifications
**Required Endpoint** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]:
- `POST /api/sessions` to start a session
- Must ensure clear contract between frontend and backend

**Authentication** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Use `auth:sanctum` middleware for security
- API route definitions should be in `routes/api.php`

### Component Specifications
No frontend components required for this backend API story.

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure patterns:
- API Routes: `routes/api.php` (to be created)
- Controller: `app/Http/Controllers/SessionController.php`
- Request: `app/Http/Requests/SessionCreateRequest.php`
- Service: `app/Services/SessionService.php` (following Repository Pattern guidance)
- Tests: `tests/Feature/SessionCreationTest.php`

### Testing Requirements
Based on existing testing patterns [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Multi-layered testing approach following testing pyramid
- Use PHPUnit for backend API testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Test authentication, validation, business logic, and response formatting
- Organize tests in `tests/Feature/` directory for API integration tests

### Technical Constraints
- Laravel Latest version [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- REST API style for frontend-backend communication [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Laravel Sanctum for SPA Authentication [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- MySQL 8.0+ database [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Follow Repository Pattern and service layer encapsulation [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

### Authentication Patterns
Based on existing codebase analysis:
- Sanctum configured for stateful SPA authentication
- Current patterns use 'auth' middleware for web routes
- API should use 'auth:sanctum' middleware
- User model has API token capabilities via HasApiTokens trait

### Controller Patterns
Based on existing controller analysis:
- Controllers extend base Controller class
- Lean controllers that delegate business logic
- Use dedicated Request classes for validation
- Return consistent response formats (JSON for API)
- Proper error handling and status codes

### Service Layer Architecture
Following architecture guidance [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Implement Repository Pattern for data access layer
- Service classes handle business logic separate from controllers
- Services should use Session model and handle user relationships
- Return structured data that controllers can format for API responses

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Test File Location**: `tests/Feature/` for API integration tests
- **Test Standards**: Follow PHPUnit conventions and Laravel API testing best practices
- **Testing Frameworks**: PHPUnit for backend testing [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Specific Requirements**: Test API authentication (auth:sanctum), request validation, business logic, and JSON response formatting
