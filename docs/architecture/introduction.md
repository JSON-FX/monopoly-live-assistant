# Introduction
This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the Monopoly Live Betting Assistant, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process.

* **Starter Template or Existing Project**
    * **N/A - Greenfield project.** No existing starter template was specified in the PRD. The architecture will be designed from scratch based on the specified technology stack (Laravel, React) and the monorepo structure assumed in the PRD, allowing for a solution custom-tailored to our specific requirements.
