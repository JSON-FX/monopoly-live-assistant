# Goals and Background Context
* **Goals**
    * To provide the user with real-time, strategy-driven "Bet" or "Skip" signals to eliminate guesswork.
    * To ensure 100% accurate execution of the selected betting strategy (initially Martingale) by automating tracking and calculations.
    * To reduce gameplay stress and errors associated with manual tracking in a fast-paced environment.
    * To deliver a robust, maintainable, and scalable application by adhering to strict SOLID principles.
* **Background Context**
    Strategic players of Monopoly Live currently face a significant challenge in manually tracking spin history and applying complex betting strategies in real-time. This manual process is stressful and prone to errors, leading to flawed strategy execution and a diminished gameplay experience. This application will solve this by providing a purpose-built tool that offloads all tracking and calculation, allowing the player to focus on the game while executing their strategy with discipline and precision.
