# Epic 1 - Foundation & User Management
* **Expanded Goal:** To establish the project's technical foundation by setting up the monorepo, installing dependencies, and configuring the database. This epic will also deliver a complete, secure user authentication system, which is a prerequisite for all other application features.
* **Stories:**
    * **1.1: Initial Project Setup**: As a Developer, I want a new Laravel and React Monorepo project to be set up, so that I have a clean and consistent foundation for development.
    * **1.2: User Data Model**: As a Developer, I want a User model and database migration created, so that user information can be persisted in the database.
    * **1.3: User Registration**: As a new User, I want to register for an account, so that I can access the application's features.
    * **1.4: User Login and Logout**: As a registered User, I want to be able to log in and log out, so that I can securely access and manage my sessions.
    * **1.5: Route Protection**: As a Developer, I want to protect application routes, so that only authenticated users can access session-related pages.
