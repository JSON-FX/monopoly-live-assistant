# Technical Assumptions
* **Repository Structure: Monorepo**
    * The project will be structured as a monorepo, containing both the Laravel backend and React frontend in a single repository. This approach will simplify dependency management and facilitate code sharing (e.g., for data types) between the two applications.
* **Service Architecture: Monolith**
    * The Laravel backend will be built as a single, monolithic service. This is the most straightforward and efficient architecture for the MVP's defined scope, simplifying development, testing, and deployment.
* **Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration**
    * The project will require both unit tests for individual components/classes and integration tests to verify interactions between different parts of the application (e.g., API endpoints connecting to the database).
* **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**
    * As previously defined, the strict implementation of SOLID principles and a component-based architecture is a mandatory assumption for all development work.
