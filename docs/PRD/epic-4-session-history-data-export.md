# Epic 4 - Session History & Data Export
* **Expanded Goal:** To deliver the long-term analytical value of the application by creating a dedicated "History" page. This will allow the user to view, analyze, and export data from all their previously completed gameplay sessions.
* **Stories:**
    * **4.1: API for Session History**: As a Frontend Developer, I want an API endpoint that provides a list of all my past sessions, so that I can display them on the History page.
    * **4.2: History Page UI**: As a User, I want to see a list of all my past gameplay sessions, so that I can track my performance over time.
    * **4.3: Session Detail View**: As a User, I want to click on a session from the History page to see its detailed spin-by-spin results, so that I can analyze a specific game.
    * **4.4: Data Export Functionality**: As a User, I want to export the data from a specific session, so that I can perform my own analysis in other tools.
