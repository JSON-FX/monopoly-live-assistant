# Epic 3 - Live Gameplay UI & Real-time Feedback
* **Expanded Goal:** To develop the complete, card-based user interface on the "Live Session" page. This epic will consume the API from Epic 2 to display session data, handle real-time spin input, and provide all the dynamic visual feedback required for live gameplay.
* **Stories:**
    * **3.1: Live Session Page Layout and Dashboard Card**: As a User, I want to see a clean, card-based layout on the Live Session page, so that I can easily view all critical session information.
    * **3.2: Status and Input Cards**: As a User, I want to see my current betting status and have clear buttons to input spin results, so that I can play the game in real-time.
    * **3.3: Live Spin History Card**: As a User, I want to see the history of spins for my current session in real-time, so that I have context for the app's decisions.
    * **3.4: Implementing Data Input Flow**: As a User, I want to click a segment button to record a spin result and see my entire dashboard update instantly, so that I can proceed to the next bet.
    * **3.5: Real-time Feedback System**: As a User, I want to receive clear visual feedback about my performance, so that I am aware of winning or losing streaks.
