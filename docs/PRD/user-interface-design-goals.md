# User Interface Design Goals
* **Overall UX Vision**
    The user experience will be that of a clean, minimalist, and highly functional "heads-up display" for the player. The interface should present critical, real-time information at a glance, acting as a professional tool that aids decision-making without distracting from the main game on another screen. The design will prioritize clarity, speed, and accuracy above all else.
* **Key Interaction Paradigms**
    * **Real-time Data Entry:** The primary interaction is the rapid tapping of segment buttons to log game results instantly.
    * **Status-driven Display:** The UI will be dominated by a large, clear, color-coded status card ("Bet"/"Skip") that commands the user's immediate attention.
    * **Single-Purpose Views:** The application will have a clear separation of concerns, with a "Live Session" page for active gameplay and a "History" page for post-game review.
* **Core Screens and Views**
    * Login Screen
    * User Registration Screen
    * Live Session Page
    * History Page
* **Accessibility**
    * **WCAG AA:** The application will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring it is usable for people with disabilities.
* **Branding**
    * A clean, modern, and data-focused aesthetic, leveraging the minimalist style of Shadcn UI. The color palette will be functional, using the defined colors (gray for '1', green for '2', etc.) to convey information about game segments and the progressive red/yellow/green system to communicate risk levels.
* **Target Device and Platforms**
    * **Web Responsive:** The application will be a responsive web app, optimized for use on both desktop and mobile browsers.
